# Introduction to Strategy

## How the Bot Works:

### Market Monitoring:
The bot pulls the latest price data (OHLCV - open, high, low, close, volume) from Binance at regular intervals (e.g., every minute). It calculates two EMAs—the 50-period EMA (short-term) and 200-period EMA (long-term)—which serve as indicators of the market trend.

### Condition Checking (Signal Generation):
For a buy signal: The bot checks if the short-term EMA crosses above the long-term EMA. This suggests a potential upward trend (bullish signal).
For a sell signal: The bot checks if the short-term EMA crosses below the long-term EMA. This suggests a potential downward trend (bearish signal).
These signals are considered "crossover events" and are common indicators in trend-following strategies.

### Trade Execution:
Once the conditions are met, the bot executes an automatic buy or sell order on Binance.
For simplicity, this bot uses market orders (buying/selling at the current market price), which ensures that the order is filled immediately. However, market orders can result in higher costs due to slippage, especially in a fast-moving market.

### Continuous Loop:
After each trade or condition check, the bot pauses for a defined interval (e.g., 60 seconds) and then repeats the process.
This continuous loop allows the bot to stay updated with market conditions and react as soon as it detects a new signal.

# Backtesting
The `EMA-Crypto-Backtest.py` file is a Python script used for backtesting a cryptocurrency trading strategy based on Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). Here are the main components:

- The script imports necessary libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, `binance.client`, and `numpy`.
- API Keys: Placeholder for Binance API keys.
- Binance Client: Initializes the Binance client using the provided API keys.
- Fetch Historical Data: Defines a function `fetch_ohlcv` to fetch historical OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data from Binance.
- Calculate EMA: Defines a function `calculate_ema` to calculate the EMA for a given period.
- Backtest Function: Defines the `backtest` function which:
  - Fetches historical data.
  - Calculates short, mid, and long EMAs (50, 100, and 200 periods).
  - Initializes variables for backtesting including initial balance and position.
  - Uses a loop to iterate through the data and checks for buy/sell signals based on EMA crossovers.
  - Logs trades and updates balance and position accordingly.

The script is designed to test the effectiveness of an EMA-based trading strategy using historical data from Binance.

# Trading Bot

The `EMA-trading-bot.py` file is a Python script that automates cryptocurrency trading using the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) strategy. Here are the key components:

- Imports: Necessary libraries like `binance.client`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib.pyplot`.
- API Setup: Initializes the Binance API with provided credentials.
- Data Fetching: Fetches historical OHLCV data from Binance.
- EMA Calculation: Functions to calculate short, mid, and long-term EMAs.
- Plotting: Function to plot price data with EMAs.
- Order Placement: Functions to place market buy and sell orders.
- Trading: Checks for buy/sell signals based on EMA crossovers and executes trades.
- Main Loop: Continuously monitors the market and trades based on signals every 60 seconds.

The bot is currently set up to trade on the BTC/USDT pair by default and places trades based on EMA crossover signals, the currency pair can be changed to any pair.

# EMA Historical Graph Plot

The `EMA-Plot.py` file is a Python script designed to plot the closing price of BTC/USDT along with its 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day moving averages. Here are the main components:

- Imports: Libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, and `binance.client` are imported.
- Binance Client: Initializes the Binance client with API credentials.
- Parameters: Defines the trading pair (`BTCUSDT`), interval (`1 day`), and the time range for the past year.
- Data Fetching: Retrieves historical candlestick data from Binance.
- Data Processing: Converts the data into a DataFrame, retains necessary columns, and calculates the moving averages.
- Plotting: Plots the closing price and the moving averages, enhancing the plot with titles, labels, and a legend.
